NavFreeWiki
===========
This is a very small chrome extension to remove navigation panels from all [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) articles.    
This was made to answer continuous rants by [@iammuneeb](http://github.com/iammuneeb).

##To Install##
Since I am not willing to publish it at the moment, you can use it by:
* Clone the repository
* Go to `chrome://extensions`
* Enable __Developer Mode__
* Click on *Load unpacked extension...*
